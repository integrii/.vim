### integrii/vim

## A simple but useful vim setup that has few conflicts, overrides, or complicated configs.  

## Componets
- Pathogen (package manager)
- vim-go (golang enhancements)
- vim-sensible (very passive boilerplate improvements)
- vim-lightline (lighter variant of vim-airline)
- vim-fugitive (git status in the status bar)
- supertab (easy tab completion)
- monokai (color theme)


## Installation
An installer is included for easy deployment.  Just run the following to clone the repo AND setup the .vimrc.  This will place your existing .vimrc file and .vim directory at .vimrc.old and .vim.old respectively.
